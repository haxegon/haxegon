Haxegon supports .mp3, .ogg or .wavs sounds, depending on your platform. Place all sound files in data/sounds/.

e.g.
  data/sounds/example.mp3
  
  in haxegon:
    Sound.play("example");

  HTML5:    
    HTML5 builds can use .mp3 or .wav files on all browsers. .oggs *will* work in some browsers, but support is varied, so .mp3 is recommended.

  Native Destop builds:
    Native desktop builds on PC, Mac and Linux require .wav or .ogg files, but cannot play .mp3 files.
    
    mp3 patent licences finally expired at the end of 2017, so this will probably change soon! mp3 support for native targets is an ongoing
    project for Haxegon's parent library OpenFL, and Haxegon will support it as soon as OpenFL does.
  
  Other:
    Legacy Flash and AIR builds can play .mp3 or .wav files, but cannot play .oggs.
    (If you're building a legacy flash project, the maximum .wav file size is 16mb).

  On windows, I use a tool called "FlicFlac" to quickly convert .wav files to .ogg and .mp3 as needed.

  Add all your audio files to data/sounds/ to use:
    data/sounds/backgroundmusic.mp3
    data/sounds/backgroundmusic.ogg
    data/sounds/explosion.mp3
    data/sounds/explosion.ogg  
  
  There are two ways to play sounds in haxegon - as sounds, which play once and stop:
    Sound.play("explosion");
  
  Or as background music, which loops until told to stop:
    Music.play("backgroundmusic");
    Music.stop();
    
  For more advanced usage, including looping sounds, fading and layering music tracks, see the reference guide at haxegon.com.
